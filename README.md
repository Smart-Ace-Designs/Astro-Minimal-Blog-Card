### What I learned

<!-- Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge. -->

I approached this design as a re-usable card component. The home page only showcases an individual card to meet to the requirements of the challenge, but the card component itself was designed to accept props/slot for content flexibilty. The tag element was set to accept an array to allow for multiple tags to be assigned to the card. This approach, arguably over-engineering the solution, helped me better understand the use of Astro Components.

I used custom Tailwind CSS theme variables to implement the custom box-shadow provided in the design specifications.
